# jQuery Image Gallery

A custom image gallery made using jQuery, JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

The first div with of class 'image' will be the first item in the gallery. Add as many as you like, the thumbnails will generate themselves.

<section class="gallery">
		<div class="container">
			<!-- <div class="image"><img src="https://placeimg.com/640/480/people" alt=""></div> -->
			<div class="thumbnails"></div>
		</div>
</section>

Include the 'gallery.js' and 'style.css' for full functionality.

This was a learning experience so any feedback/criticism is welcome.
